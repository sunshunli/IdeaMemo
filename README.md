## ✨ Features

**IdeaMemo** is an Android lightweight note-taking app.

Here are the current features:

- **Privacy First** : No need to apply any permissions, all runtime data is firmly stored in your local database or can be uploaded to your own WEBDAV private cloud.

## 🤗 Thanks
This project was created by Compose. Some of the project's code is derived from excellent open-source projects.

I'll gradually improve it, but the power of one person is limited. Pull requests are welcome.
